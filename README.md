Basic-Electronics:
This reposity contains circuit schematics (TinkerCAD screenshots), microcontroller code, and word files that explain each projects. 

How to Use:
Find a specific project you want to learn, preview the schematic and code, then dive into the explanation. Research items as needed, 
but after you have a good understanding, try building the project yourself on TinkerCAD (which is free). Refer back to the explanation as needed, 
then complete the project with the real components.
